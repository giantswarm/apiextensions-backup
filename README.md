# apiextensions-backup

This repository defines the Giant Swarm Kubernetes APIs in the `backup.giantswarm.io` group including the following:

- `ETCDBackup`

**Note: These APIs were originally defined in `giantswarm/apiextensions` and were moved here to simplify dependency graphs.**

## Code Generation

Code generation is used to generate:

- `DeepCopy` methods for each Go type to satisfy the `runtime.Object` interface (`zz_generated.deepcopy.go`).
- CRDs for each API in YAML format to be applied to a Kubernetes cluster before creating CRs using that API (`config/crd`).

Regenerate these files using `make generate`. Other options can be viewed in `Makefile.custom.mk`.

Additionally, example CRs are generated from code in Go tests using `go test ./... -update`.

## Update docs

When a new release is created the reference needs to be updated in the [docs config].

## Sync CRDs

All CRDs are embedded in [apptestctl] and the Chart CRD is embedded in [app-operator].

### apptestctl

```sh
$ make sync-crds
```

### app-operator

```sh
$ make sync-chart-crd
```

[apptestctl]: https://github.com/giantswarm/apptestctl
